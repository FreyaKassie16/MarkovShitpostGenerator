# MarkovShitpostGenerator
Generate delightfully random and occasionally nonsensical sentences using Markov Chains. This Python project leverages Markov Chain models to construct sentences based on input text, with a touch of "shitposting" for added humor and randomness. Introduce a dash of chaos to your text generation experiments and have fun with the unpredictable output!
